    "Since the farm does not have its own warehouse, production is limited to a maximum of 60 tons. The farm has its own demand for these crops and therefore consumes part of its production, requiring the planting of at least 400 m² of wheat, 800 m² of rice, and 10,000 m² of corn. The area to be planted with each crop must be decided so that total profit is maximized. Formulate the problem using linear programming."
