# 📈 Operational Research

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains practical exercises and implementations from the **Operational Research** course, with a special focus on **Linear Programming** and **Integer Linear Programming**. All activities are developed using **Python**, taking advantage of interactive notebooks and optimization libraries.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- 🧮 **Mathematical modeling**: Represent real-world problems using linear constraints and objective functions.
- ♻️ **Optimization techniques**: Apply simplex method, branch-and-bound, and solver tools to find optimal solutions.
- 📊 **Decision support**: Use programming models to assist in logistics, production, and resource allocation.
- 💡 **Problem-solving logic**: Strengthen abstract reasoning through constraint-based problem formulation.

---

## 💻 Languages Used

- **Python**: For implementation of optimization models and algorithmic simulations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For building and testing interactive models.
